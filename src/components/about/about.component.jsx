<h1>FeedMe is a service that connects food shelters to restaurants, caterers and grocery stores
     in order to minimize food waste. The initiative started in 2020, when local restaurants started 
     considering an alternative to food waste management. The founders of the web service, graduate
     McGill students, are planning on nationalizing the service in order to create a large-scale impact
     on our patterns of food management, while giving back to those most in need.
