<h1>About</h1><p>FeedGreen started in 2020, when local restaurants started considering an alternative to food 
    waste management. The founders of the web service, graduate McGill students, are planning on 
    nationalizing the service in order to create a large-scale impact on our patterns of food 
    management, while giving back to those most in need.
